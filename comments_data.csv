Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as faith and patience. We should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end.

There is not much to improve on especially for the average consumer.  Any improvements it no longer becomes a phone . Even the foldable phone has it's limits if maintaining the definition of a phone. And so to me it makes since for companies to extend the longevity of it's devices. Upgrades are becoming in a sense desperation. No real advantage nor incentive for the average consumer. I mean honestly 60hz vs 120hz, who cares, humans just are not ready for that kind of impatience. They are inpatient as it is.but honestly not much more I can see in incentives. And Apple amongst others are confirming my hypothesis. You can only put so much into the rectangular object we call a smartphone . So upgrades besides security become superfluous. My humble opinion.\n\n4 Signs Smartphones Have Peaked\n1. Smartphones Look the Same Now\nModern smartphones look almost identical from the front because they've evolved to best fit their function, showing the most content while taking the least amount of room. The Dynamic Island on the iPhone 14 Pro is unique, but under-display camera tech will eventually make all smartphone fronts look the same.\n\nLuckily, things are much more exciting at the back. Put a Google Pixel, a Samsung Galaxy, an iPhone, and a Xiaomi flagship phone face down next to each other, and it'll become clear how each brand is trying to build a unique identity for their phones. 2. Benchmark Scores Don't Matter Anymore\nAlthough apps like AnTuTu and Geekbench are good indicators of how powerful a phone is, benchmark scores are irrelevant now for the vast majority of regular users. After a certain point (about 700,000 points on AnTuTu), the scores start to lose meaning.\n\nIn fact, the iPhone 14 uses the same chip as iPhone 13, the A15 Bionic.\n\nAnother reason to disregard benchmark scores is that they're not always an accurate representation of the phone's real-world performance. Some manufacturers set their devices to detect if a benchmark app is running to make it avoid throttling and inflate its performance, showing you an exaggerated score.\n3. You Only Get Small Yearly Upgrades\nEarlier, each new generation of smartphones introduced something that would become mainstream. For example, smartphones first got a rear camera and Bluetooth in 2002, a selfie camera and 3G in 2003, Wi-Fi in 2004, headphone jacks in 2005, and touch screens in 2006.\n\nThey also got fingerprint sensors in 2007, 4G and AMOLED screens in 2008, HD video in 2009, FHD video in 2010, HD display in 2011, wireless charging and FHD display in 2012, QHD display and 4K video in 2013, USB-C ports in 2015, and 5G in 2019.\n\nAs time passes, new revolutionary features become few and far between.\n4. Flagships Aren't That Special Anymore\nMany features previously exclusive to flagships are now easily available on cheaper phones, such as 4K video, wireless charging, in-display fingerprint scanner, and more. Companies come up with all sorts of overhyped features in flagships to try to upsell buyers.\n\nThat's why we recommend you pick Galaxy A over Galaxy S phones if you're a Samsung fan. Sadly, for Apple users, the budget iPhone SE series retains an outdated design, poor battery life, and a single rear camera and is not recommendable."", 'My 13 pro max got the white screen of death just post warranty.

Kind regards Peter :-)', 'is that the 11 or 12.9 inch table you are showing?', 'I think it\'s disappointing that Apple _needs_ to avoid cannibalizing their own products. It suggests to me that Apple is too stupid to innovate fully while making even more money. They need to limit the functionality of their own products so that each one is still worth something to their users. And while the original iPad seemed to be Apple\'s idea of a netbook, the modern iPads have gone so far beyond that that there\'s little difference in capability between their laptops and tablets, except where they make it.\n\nApple has a lot going for it, but being the cutting-edge master of technology is definitely not part of the equation. Their latest innovation is really a vast improvement over their ARM chips for phones and tablets. A previous one was using USB-C exclusively on their laptops starting with the 12-inch MacBook. And let\'s all remember the removal of the headphone jack and phone chargers! I assume there\'s a ton of software ideas they\'ve implemented, but none of them have been so far ahead of the competition that they can be claimed as innovations. Apple AirTags came out after Tile.\n\nI just don\'t think Apple is an exciting company. I was sold on them after my recent frustrations with Chromebooks and Chrome OS. There\'s no way I want a Windows laptop and I don\'t want to be bothered getting one only to install Linux on it. I\'d buy a MacBook because everything is so polished. But as far as I can tell, everything about Apple that could be called ""new"" isn\'t any more exciting than the latest indie game, mouse, TV, or law concerning our privacy rights. Apple just has a nicer package and presentation but their stuff is just a somewhat higher-quality version of stuff we\'ve already seen.\n\nApple is just a highly successful business that depends heavily on keeping up appearances and being just competitive enough that those already invested in Apple remain convinced that Apple\'s still the best. They are not the stupendous company some of us wish they were and they will never do anything so much better than the competition that it changes everything. Even their Apple silicon is limited to their own products and most everyone else is satisfied with the ARM processors in their phones already.\n\nI need to stop checking videos like this hoping it\'s something worth my attention. Apple, frankly, is just a very polished utility that refuses to outdo itself against its own financial self-interests, especially if it exposes just how utterly limited they are in their vision and willingness to be more than they already are and have been since Steve Jobs died.', 'I think the idea is simple. If iPad as a personal PC can wreck all category of markets (windows / Linux) then Apple go for making iPad a PC. They have no reason to dumb Mac otherwise. They evolve their products at the cost of another often to conquer markets across the spectrum. Like how iPhone killed iPod but iPhone also wrecked across the market giving them so much new money.', 'Ipad has the same problem as Iphone. Their OS is locked 🔒 and will remain locked 🔒.\n\n The devices are deliberately handicapped to force you to ""buy the whole lineup"" or ""full ecosystem"". An Ipad will never do what a Mac can because than you dont buy the whole ecosystem...it just shrunk by a device and Apple\'s profits shrunk.\n\nFor some reason the limitations bother me more on the iPhone than on the Ipad since I need my phone to do more. I\'ve been okay using an Ipad for the odd Facetime call, email and as a media consumption device... but now Im questioning that.\n\nCurrently I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and every other device is Apple. However, I am considering ditching the Ipad and only using Mac. \n\nIt seems as though Samsung tablets are now better than Ipads simply because they are free devices that you fully own and can do anything you want with. \n\nOlder Samsungs lacked the power to really be usable but current gen are great tablets but can function as Chrome OS devices as well so you have full computer level functionality when you need it and full tablet functionality when you need it... something the Ipad can\'t offer.\n\nThe only drawbacks with Samsung tablets are they dont seem to be made to be used in portrait mode... primarily landscape. I\'m a musician and like to use a tablet for lyrics. Also, there are a few pesky apps not available on Android yet. Lumafusion going to Android is cool...but there are others I need. The growth of ChromeOS also causes Dex Mode in Samsung devices to get better. Hopefully soon it will have evolved to the point that it is as powerful as Mac OS or Windows.\n\nI don\'t know what to do...maybe time to go to Best Buy and compare the devices in store.']"

I took a chance on something different, it wasn't flashy and full of shit like the iPhone or Samsung, it wasn't gross and primitive like a phone mums use that are so simple yet they can't wrap their head around it. It was high quality, durable, waterproof, great camera, Android is the bomb, reliable, great speakers and amazing in general without being cheap and horribly made. It's the first phone I haven't smashed by accident because I got a wallet case. It's the first phone that I truly love everything about it, it never broke, it is reliable it is running the latest OS, it does everything I want it too do, it looks great after 3 years, it still surprises me when I find a new feature I didn't know earlier, perfect size, battery is great, camera is still amazing... I've never loved a phone before, I liked them but there was always something I hated. I never hated anything about my 2 XL. So much so that I can upgrade if I chose, the Pixel 5 looks exciting and new (But kind of cheap), the Pixel 4 XL is a sexy looking phone, I'd put the 4 XL & the 2 XL looks wise in the same bag, they look and feel great. Pixel, Pixel 3 XL & Pixel 5 just look cheap or shit when it comes to how looks wise it will age. I'm truly upset my 2 XL is no longer getting support from Google, but I still don't feel the desire to upgrade. I'm keeping this bitch until she truly dies and I have to get a new phone.

Also, some of you are wondering how do I know that my session is recording when the LCD doesnt work. The only way I know my  camera is recording is when its connected to power.

Those were scary days of paranoia!\n\nCases have saved me a few times, such as when standing up while forgetting that my phone was in my lap.\n\nI have a tip to share regarding case installation. Use that little lens cloth or microfiber cloth that came with the screen protector and lay that inside the back half of your case before putting it on your phone. It'll act as a gasket to snug up the fit a little bit, and prevent some scratches from slowly happening to the back of the phone touching the case or whatever contaminants find their way into your pocket and behind your phone.✅"", 'Hi MKBHD whats your opinion on using smart phones with cases now?', 'Sponsored by Dbrand', 'Six or seven hundred dollars phone 😂', ""I used to use cases, and screen protectors on all of my phones, up until the Galaxy 5. I used a screen protector, and a case on it, for a couple of years, but the screen protector started to bubble, and collect debris underneath it. I peeled it off, and the display quality was immediately better. The display was sharper, the feedback was phenomenal, it was like having a brand-new phone. I haven't used any after-market protectors since then. It seems counter-intuitive, to purchase an $1800 phone, only to immediately cover it with additional layers. You buy the phone with the latest and greatest technology, why would you hinder it? If people are that concerned with protecting their phones, then maybe they're shopping out of their range. I wouldn't normally recommend extended warranties to people, but I think the trade-off between that and after-market screen protection, is worth it."", 'Her King', ""Dropped all my phones over the years several times, and yet never had a single crack on the screen or body, thanks to the case I always put my phone in. So yes, phone cases do work. The first thing I do after I get a new phone is put a screen protector and a case on it. I don't care about the looks of my phone. For me a phone is a tool, not some fashion accessory to flash around. Nobody cares about your phone.

I stumbled upon this while exploring MKBHD after a mention from PixImperfect. Curiosity led me to delve into his older videos, and I found myself resonating a lot with this young individual. Back when I had a YouTube channel over 16 years ago, I unknowingly dabbled in creating thumbnails and catchy titles, though I didn't fully realize it then. It's incredibly inspiring to witness a young person engage in such endeavors! It's amazing to think you were already passionate about sharing knowledge back then, seemingly way ahead of your time. You seemed to possess remarkable wisdom and intelligence for someone so young."", 'mmmm did he removed the picture intro? wow', 'Why am I seeing this today ?', 'Just watched the cybertruck review and jumped to this 👍', 'So the YouTube algorithm just throws a 14 years old video of Marques.']"
